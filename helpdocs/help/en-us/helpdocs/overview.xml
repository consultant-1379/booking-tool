      The purpose of the PDU OSS Deployment Tracking Tool (DTT) is to provide an inventory system
      that catalogues each Deployment, Product, Hardware and all other associated Artifacts within
      a single-page web application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Functionalities exist for searching, filtering and exporting sets of data from the tool in
      CSV format. Based on their selected program and RA preference, users can view subsets of artifacts and orchestrate them
      with respect to their associated Deployments.
    </p>
    <p>
      DTT also provides functionalities such as making Bookings for any Deployment within the
      tool.
