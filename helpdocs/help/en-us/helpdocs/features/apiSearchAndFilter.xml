        All examples on this page are shown as unencoded, where "name = 'myDeployment'" is encoded as "name+%3d+%27myDeployment%27".
        Client libraries handle this encoding automatically.

        When using the GET method on the API the results can be searched by adding ?q=&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt; to the end of your request.
        Using this you can search the GET to only show results that meet your criteria.
        <b>Example:</b> /api/deployments?q=name=myDeployment
        This example will only show Deployments that have the name 'myDeployment', if no Deployment is named 'myDeployment' an empty array is returned.

        Use a.b to search using field b that is nested within field a;
        <b>Example:</b> /api/deployments?q=products.product_type_name=ENM_SED
        This example will only show Deployments that have a Product with the Product-Type name 'ENM_SED', if no Deployment has a Product with the Product-Type name 'ENM_SED' an empty array is returned.

      <title id="search">Filter</title>
      <lines>
        When using the GET method on the API the results can be filtered by adding ?fields=fieldName to the end of your request.
        Using this you can filter the GET to return a partial response.
        <b>Example:</b> /api/deployments?fields=name
        This example will only show the names of all the Deployments.

        Use a,b to select multiple fields,authUrl
        <b>Example:</b> /api/deployments?fields=name,purpose
        This example will show the names and purposes of all the Deployments.

        Use a/b or a(b) to select a field b that is nested within field a;
        <b>Example:</b> /api/deployments?fields=products/product_type_name or /api/deployments?fields=products(product_type_name)

        These can be used in conjunction with the search above to return a partial response of a specific search.
        <b>Example:</b> /api/deployments?q=status=Free&amp;fields=name
        This will return the names of all Deployments that have status set to 'Free'.
